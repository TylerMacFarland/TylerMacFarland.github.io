									<h1>About Me!<br /></h1>
									<p>A little about myself and my background.</p>
								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/about_me.jpg" alt="" /></div>
								<p>I went to Western Michigan University and graduated with a degree in Paper Engineering in 2019. During my time at WMU I had two internships, each a summer in length, and a Co-Op that lasted eight months. 
									I graduated and got my first job at a paper mill in beautiful southern California. After about three years in industry I realized that the role as an engineer in an industrial setting was not what 
									I wanted to do long term. So I left my company on good terms and have been studying data analytics ever since. I have completed the Google Data Analytics Course hosted on Coursera as well as some supplement 
									courses on Udemy about SQL. The Google Data Analytics course taught me practical applications such as SQL, Tableau, and some coding in R. These courses combined with skills from my years as an engineer 
									give me the knowledge I need for my career shift into Data Analytics. This webstie holds the projects I have already completed in order to display these skills!    </p>
								<p>There were many reasons for my desire to shift career paths, too many to cover them all but making this change is something I not only feel confident about but excited for as well. When I first started taking 
									these courses in data analytics I wasnt completly sure if I was going to enjoy it or not. The more I progressed though the more excited I found myself becoming. My time as an enineer was engaging in a lot of ways
									but I rarely found much joy in the work. It was something I could do but I never really got much satisfaction from. When I started to learn more about the data analytics field I quickly found that not only was 
									I picking up new skills I was truly enjoying them. When I find something I enjoy, I want to learn as much about it as I can and love spend hours researching and getting 
									lost in the subject, whether that be music or board games or in this case data. As I began learning SQL and exploring how data can tell stories I found myself engrossed in it. Data was like a puzzle and I was learning how to
									find all the pieces. Once I realized this was happening I knew that, while things can always change, I was excited for the prospect of my new career path.
								</p>
								<p>In my free time I love to hike, play guitar, read, play board games with friends, and perform improv comedy. Since moving out of the Midwest and to California I have fallen in love with backpacking.
									The picture above is me from my trip on the John Muir Trail in the Sierra Nevada mountain range.
